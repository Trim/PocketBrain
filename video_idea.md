Game of Emotions
================

# The one who control his emotions, can...
* keep calm in any condition
* improve expression of what you want
* improve expression of how you feel
* improve how other feel you

# So, he can be on the FER throne
Indeed, he will be "master of his emotions"
So he can take the best decision in every situation
And he'll never be manipulated by others

# But the question his learn to control emotions ?

# With help of emotionless computers !

# Computer to control emotions ??
## Computer can _measure_ your emotions :
* it determines how you feel with 2 values :
  * arousal : are you _calm_ or _exited_ ?
  * valence : feel you _positiveness_ or _negativeness_ ?

## But you have to train it :
* So it knows what is your _brain activity_ for each emotion you have
* And it can apply _statistics_ to know which are your current emotion

# Computer isn't really _TRANSPORTABLE_ ...
Use your Android phone !
Smartphone are _real computers_ now !

# Wait, you've said "measure brain activity" ? We'll have to go in _hospital_ ?
No, you'll be able to do it every where with emotive headset!

If you train enough your computer, you'll have some good results
