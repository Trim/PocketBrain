Imagine a world were every one
has a _smartphone_ with electronic _wears_

====
These smartphone will be able to say you :

"Hey John, I think you should take some vacancies! You were
very _stressed_ last week...
====
... I see you'll be still really _busy next week_, after it will
be a good time to go to _Italy_ with your familly.
During this week, there's _less tourists_ and the see temperature
is engouh to make some _swiming_..."
====
To be continued...
After some more indication, your smartphone will be able to 
book some airplane hotels directly using your credit cards.
====
How will it be possible ?
The key point to make such propositions, the smartphone need to
understand your _feelings_.
Social networks, calendar managements, on-line shop will provide
all other informations.
====
What about actual _smart_phones ?
Social network
Calendar, contacts, ...
Online shops (Google Play, AppStore,...)
Almost good performance
But can't "feel" you
====
"Feel" you ?
Research have been done about human emotions and how to understand them // alpha beta gamma symbols
Hardware quite _expensive_ and _intrusive_
====
Another solution ?
Yes, EMOCAP is a headset very less intrusive, cheaper
but with less precision.
But the software to develop is expensive and closed-source.

Fortunately, recently, a project has been open-sourced
to process informations directly on a smartphone
====
What is our goal ?
Use this project as core of a mobile application to take some
decision according your feeling.
====
What have you done ?
Read papers about emotion
Get rid of proprietary code of the open-sourced project
Run and understand the open-source project on computer and capture some signals
with hello-world application and EEG-Viewer

But get stuck with an application to view brain activity on a 3D brain

====
What's future plan ?
Try to make own simple application to get feelings with Valence/Arousal idea
Find another solution to do this, because there's a lot of risk that headset 
isn't enough precise.
If really not possible, use P300 signal to make some menu navigation helper
